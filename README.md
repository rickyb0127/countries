# REST Countries API with color theme switcher
This is my solution to the challenge [REST Countries API with color theme switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

## Overview

**Brief**
Your challenge is integrating with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end, such as React or Vue. You also have complete control over which packages you use to make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
